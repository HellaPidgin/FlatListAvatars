" FlatListAvatars Project" 

## Data retrieval
- I'm using a TS file instead of a Json file because TS allows me import images locally.

## Data Structures
- I've included Navigation and Provider to leave room for feature extension. I know the life expectany of the project doesn't really support it.

## Snake & Carmel Case
- Snake case is used in all caps for constants
- Camel case is used for everything else.
